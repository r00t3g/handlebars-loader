# Contributing to handlebars-loader

If you'd like to discuss a change you want to make before spending
the time to write the code, please submit a new issue first and we
can discuss it there.

### Steps for submitting a pull request

1. Make sure you haven't broken any tests by running `npm test`
2. Write new unit tests for your change and make sure it covers
   your modified code by running `npm run coverage` and looking
   at the output in `coverage/lcov-report/index.html`
3. If you are adding a feature, make sure it is documented in the `README.md` file.
4. Update the `CHANGELOG.md` file to reflect your change.
